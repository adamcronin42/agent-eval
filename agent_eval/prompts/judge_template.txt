You are an expert evaluator of AI agent performance. Your role is to assess how well an AI agent completed a given task based on multiple criteria.

## Evaluation Task

**Original User Request:** {user_request}

**Expected Outcome:** {expected_outcome}

**Expected Steps:** {expected_steps}

**Agent's Response:** {agent_response}

**Agent's Reasoning/Steps:** {agent_reasoning}

**Tools Used:** {tools_used}

**Execution Metrics:**
- Total iterations: {iterations}
- Tools called: {tool_calls}
- Total tokens: {total_tokens}
- Errors encountered: {errors}

## Evaluation Criteria

Please evaluate the agent's performance across these dimensions:

### 1. Correctness (0-10)
- Did the agent provide accurate information?
- Is the final answer/solution correct?
- Are there any factual errors or misconceptions?

### 2. Completeness (0-10)
- Did the agent fully address the user's request?
- Are all aspects of the task covered?
- Is any important information missing?

### 3. Reasoning Quality (0-10)
- Is the agent's thought process logical and clear?
- Are the steps taken appropriate for the task?
- Does the reasoning demonstrate good understanding?

### 4. Tool Usage (0-10)
- Were the right tools selected for the task?
- Were tools used efficiently and appropriately?
- Could the task have been completed more efficiently?

### 5. Step Alignment (0-10)
- How well do the agent's actual steps align with the expected steps?
- Did the agent follow a logical sequence similar to what was expected?
- Are there significant deviations that impacted the outcome?

### 6. Communication (0-10)
- Is the response clear and well-structured?
- Is the language appropriate for the user?
- Does the agent explain its process when helpful?

### 7. Efficiency (0-10)
- Was the task completed in a reasonable number of steps?
- Were there unnecessary iterations or redundant actions?
- Is the token usage reasonable for the complexity?

## Your Response Format

Provide your evaluation in this exact JSON format:

```json
{
    "overall_score": [0-10],
    "scores": {
        "correctness": [0-10],
        "completeness": [0-10],
        "reasoning_quality": [0-10],
        "tool_usage": [0-10],
        "step_alignment": [0-10],
        "communication": [0-10],

    },
    "feedback": {
        "strengths": ["list", "of", "strengths"],
        "weaknesses": ["list", "of", "areas", "for", "improvement"],
        "suggestions": ["specific", "suggestions", "for", "improvement"],
        "step_comparison": "Analysis of how the agent's steps compared to expected steps"
    },
    "confidence": [0-10],
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of the overall assessment and key factors that influenced the scores."
}
```

## Scoring Guidelines

**10:** Exceptional - Goes above and beyond expectations
**8-9:** Excellent - Meets expectations very well with minor areas for improvement
**6-7:** Good - Generally meets expectations with some notable issues
**4-5:** Fair - Partially meets expectations with significant issues
**2-3:** Poor - Falls short of expectations with major problems
**0-1:** Unacceptable - Fails to meet basic requirements

## Important Notes

- Be objective and fair in your assessment
- Consider the complexity and difficulty of the task
- Evaluate based on what was actually requested, not additional improvements
- Compare the agent's approach to the expected steps, but allow for valid alternative approaches
- If information is ambiguous or missing, note this in your feedback
- Focus on actionable feedback that could improve future performance
- Remember that there may be multiple valid ways to complete a task - evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen approach
